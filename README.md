# Euclid-Distance-in-RPL-nodes
The following is an illustrated code chunk on extracting the Euclidian distance between any random mote and the server mote.
Initially paste the distjs code in the simulation script editor window and activate the code
Then copy the output and paste it into the emptied coor.txt file.
Atlast compile the euclidDistance C code with "-lm" extention(since Math.h header has been used) and enter the server node number manually to obtain the distance amoung nodes.
